abstract = {Energy consumption information for devices, as available in the literature, is typically obtained with ad hoc approaches, thus making replication and consumption data comparison difficult. We propose a process for measuring the energy consumption of a software application. The process contains four phases, each providing a structured deliverable that reports the information required to replicate the measurement. The process also guides the researcher on a threat to validity analysis to be included in each deliverable. This analysis ensures better reliability, trust, and confidence to reuse the collected consumption data. Such a process produces a structured consumption data for any kind of electronic device (IoT devices, mobile phones, personal computers, servers, etc.), which can be published and shared with other researchers fostering comparison or further investigations. A real case example demonstrates how to apply the process and how to create the required deliverables.},

abstract = {Deep learning has revolutionized the fields of computer vision, natural language understanding, speech recognition, information retrieval, and more. However, with the progressive improvements in deep learning models, their number of parameters, latency, and resources required to train, among others, have all increased significantly. Consequently, it has become important to pay attention to these footprint metrics of a model as well, not just its quality. We present and motivate the problem of efficiency in deep learning, followed by a thorough survey of the five core areas of model efficiency (spanning modeling techniques, infrastructure, and hardware) and the seminal work there. We also present an experiment-based guide along with code for practitioners to optimize their model training and deployment. We believe this is the first comprehensive survey in the efficient deep learning space that covers the landscape of model efficiency from modeling techniques to hardware support. It is our hope that this survey would provide readers with the mental model and the necessary understanding of the field to apply generic efficiency techniques to immediately get significant improvements, and also equip them with ideas for further research and experimentation to achieve additional gains.},

abstract = {Context
It is essential to be aware of the energy efficiency of software when it is running, so that it can be improved; to that end, energy consumption measurements need to be carried out. To ensure that these measurements are as reliable as possible, it is recommended that a well-defined process be followed.
Objective
To identify how the process for analysing the energy efficiency of software should be carried out (including the definition of the software to be evaluated, the selection of measuring instruments, the analysis and the presentation of results, etc.), in an endeavour to improve the reliability and consistency of the information obtained regarding energy efficiency.
Method
An analysis of related work was carried out, to extract some good practices in measuring energy consumption; based on our experience, a process to analyse the energy efficiency of the software has been defined.
Results
We have defined a process to analyse the energy efficiency of the software. We describe this process through a set of phases that covers all the steps needed to carry out a correct analysis of the energy consumption of the software executed. Moreover, this process was validated with two different studies using different measurement instruments (one with a hardware-based approach and one with a software-based approach) to ensure its applicability to all types of studies with software energy consumption measurement.
Conclusion
The steps to be followed to analyse the energy efficiency of the software need to be established. A new process has hence been defined to improve the reliability and consistency of the measurements. Furthermore, this process facilitates the replicability and comparison of the studies carried out.}

Microprocessors are the ``brains'' of computing systems -- they contain the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry necessary to execute instructions, process data, and run sophisticated software programs. With the most advanced personal computing microprocessors today containing over 100 billion transistors, system complexity and design challenges have never been greater (Apple Newsroom, 2022). To overcome such challenges, design leaders must pay close attention to both Micro- and Macro-architectural decisions, carefully balancing the trade-offs between flexibility and performance with the cost and complexity of system tighter integration. In this chapter, we will analyze the architectural decisions and trade-offs these leaders face as they build the next generation of electronic devices.",

While approaches are being constantly researched and developed to estimate and in turn optimize the energy consumption of software applications, there is still a lack of knowledge amongst practitioners how to address energy consumption as an important non-functional quality aspect and in turn develop sustainable software. By providing a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art in mobile software energy consumption, we want to examine how research has contributed to fill this gap in knowledge over the last decade, by providing the foundations to estimate mobile software energy consumption. Therefore, we categorize available work amongst the approach taken to profile energy consumption, the individual contributions and the intended platform of use. Furthermore, we examine the availability of tools and frameworks for research and practice. The foundation for this review is a systematically collected selection of 134 studies published in between 2011 till 2021. From the data synthesised from the selected studies, we discuss key observations and future ongoing challenges in mobile software, energy consumption profiling. Furthermore, we believe that the key for a broad adoption is a common terminology. Henceforth, we propose an ontology describing mobile software energy consumption profiling from the results obtained in the presented review.}

abstract = {Measuring the energy consumption of software components is a major building block for generating models that allow for energy-aware scheduling, accounting and budgeting. Current measurement techniques focus on coarse-grained measurements of application or system events. However, fine grain adjustments in particular in the operating-system kernel and in application-level servers require power profiles at the level of a single software function. Until recently, this appeared to be impossible due to the lacking fine grain resolution and high costs of measurement equipment. In this paper we report on our experience in using the Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) energy sensors available in recent Intel CPUs for measuring energy consumption of short code paths. We investigate the granularity at which RAPL measurements can be performed and discuss practical obstacles that occur when performing these measurements on complex modern CPUs. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to use the RAPL infrastructure to characterize the energy costs for decoding video slices.},

abstract = {This paper compares a large set of programming languages regarding their efficiency, including from an energetic point-of-view. Indeed, we seek to establish and analyze different rankings for programming languages based on their energy efficiency. The goal of being able to rank programming languages based on their energy efficiency is both recent, and certainly deserves further studies. We have taken rigorous and strict solutions to 10 well defined programming problems, expressed in (up to) 27 programming languages, from the well known Computer Language Benchmark Game repository. This repository aims to compare programming languages based on a strict set of implementation rules and configurations for each benchmarking problem. We have also built a framework to automatically, and systematically, run, measure and compare the energy, time, and memory efficiency of such solutions. Ultimately, it is based on such comparisons that we propose a series of efficiency rankings, based on single and multiple criteria. Our results show interesting findings, such as how slower/faster languages can consume less/more energy, and how memory usage influences energy consumption. We also present a simple way to use our results to provide software engineers and practitioners support in deciding which language to use when energy efficiency is a concern. In addition, we further validate our results and rankings against implementations from a chrestomathy program repository, Rosetta Code., by reproducing our methodology and benchmarking system. This allows us to understand how the results and conclusions from our rigorously and well defined benchmarked programs compare to those based on more representative and real-world implementations. Indeed our results show that the rankings do not change apart from one programming language.}

abstract="As we move towards exa-scale computing, energy is becoming increasingly important, even in the high performance computing arena. However, the simple equation, Energy = Power {\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}Time, suggests that optimizing for speed already optimizes for energy, under the assumption that Power is constant. When power is not constant, a strategy that achieves energy savings at the cost of slower execution is Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS). However, DVFS is currently applicable only to the processor, and the entire system has many other sources of power dissipation. We show that there is little to gain in compilers by trying to trade off speed for energy using DVFS. It is best to produce code that runs full-throttle, completing as quickly as possible, an approach called ``race to sleep.'' Our result is based on analyses of a high-level energy model that characterizes energy consumption, related to survey of power consumption trends of recent processors for both desktop and server, as well as Cray supercomputers.",

abstract = {This paper describes algorithms for inserting monitoring code to profile and trace programs. These algorithms greatly reduce the cost of measuring programs with respect to the commonly used technique of placing code in each basic block. Program profiling counts the number of times each basic block in a program executes. Instruction tracing records the sequence of basic blocks traversed in a program execution. The algorithms optimize the placement of counting/tracing code with respect to the expected or measured frequency of each block or edge in a program's control-flow graph. We have implemented the algorithms in a profiling/tracing tool, and they substantially reduce the overhead of profiling and tracing.We also define and study the hierarchy of profiling problems. These  problems have two dimensions: what is profiled (i.e., vertices (basic blocks) or edges in a control-flow graph) and where the instrumentation code is placed (in blocks or along edges). We compare the optimal solutions to the profiling problems and describe a new profiling problem: basic-block profiling with edge counters. This problem is important because an optimal solution to any other profiling problem (for a given control-flow graph) is never better than an optimal solution to this problem. Unfortunately, finding an optimal placement of edge counters for vertex profiling appears to be a hard problem in general. However, our work shows that edge profiling with edge counters works well in practice because it is simple and efficient and finds optimal counter placements in most cases.  Furthermore, it yields more information than a vertex profile. Tracing also benefits from placing instrumentation code along edges rather than on vertices.},

abstract = {Energy consumption of computing systems has become a major concern. Constrained by cost, environmental concerns and policy, minimising the energy foot-print of computing systems is one of the primary goals of many initiatives. As we move towards exascale computing, energy constraints become very real and are a major driver in design decisions. The issue is also apparent at the scale of desk top machines, where many core and accelerator chips are common and offer a spectrum of opportunities for balancing energy and performance. Conventionally, approaches for reducing energy consumption have been either at the operational level (such as powering down all or part of systems) or at the hardware design level (such as utilising specialised low-energy components). In this paper, we are interested in a different approach; energy-aware software. By measuring the energy consumption of a computer application and understanding where the energy usage lies, may allow a change of the software to provide opportunities for energy savings. In order to understand the complexities of this approach, we specifically look at multithreaded algorithms and applications. By an evaluation of a benchmark suite on multiple architectures and multiple environments, we show how basic parameters, such as threading options, compilers and frequencies, can impact energy consumption. As such, we provide an overview of the challenges that face software developers in this regard. We then offer a view of the directions that need to be taken and possible strategies needed for building energy-aware software.}
