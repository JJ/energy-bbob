  abstract = {Motivation: The energy efficiency of it-related products, from the
              software perspective, has gained vast popularity the recent years
              and paved a new emerging research field. However, there is limited
              number of research works regarding the energy consumption of
              relatively small programming tasks. This knowledge is critical to
              be known especially in cases where millions of small tasks are
              running in parallel on multiple devices all around the globe.Goal:
              In this preliminary study, we aim to identify energy implications
              of small, independent tasks developed in different programming
              languages; compiled, semi-compiled, and interpreted ones.Method: To
              achieve our purpose, we collected, refined, compared, and analyzed
              a number of implemented tasks from Rosetta Code, that is a publicly
              available Repository for programming chrestomathy.Results: Our
              analysis shows that among compiled programming languages such as C,
              C++, Java, and Go offer the highest energy efficiency for all of
              our tested tasks compared to C#, VB.Net, and Rust. Regarding
              interpreted programming languages PHP, Ruby, and JavaScript exhibit
              the most energy savings compared to Swift, R, Perl, and Python.},

  abstract = {A new algorithm called Mersenne Twister (MT) is proposed for
              generating uniform pseudorandom numbers. For a particular choice of
              parameters, the algorithm provides a super astronomical period of
              219937-1 and 623-dimensional equidistribution up to 32-bit accuracy
              , while using a working area of only 624 words. This is a new
              variant of the previously proposed generators, TGFSR, modified so
              as to admit a Mersenne-prime period. The characteristic polynomial
              has many terms. The distribution up to v bits accuracy for 1 ≤ v ≤
              32 is also shown to be good. An algorithm is also given that checks
              the primitivity of the characteristic polynomial of MT with
              computational complexity O(p2) where p is the degree of the
              polynomial.We implemented this generator in portable C-code. It
              passed several stringent statistical tests, including diehard. Its
              speed is comparable to other modern generators. Its merits are due
              to the efficient algorithms that are unique to polynomial
              calculations over the two-element field.},
