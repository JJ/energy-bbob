	paper</a>, the author talks about how Ulysses is pretty much about
	electrification and how it flows and can be measured. It literally says
	that it has "intense attention ... to the ways in which the lived
	            experience of individual bodies involves the disbursement of
	energy". In this case, the same happens with computers. James Joyce vive
	en Trieste entre 1905 y 1915; Ulysses was published in 1922; he wrote
	some chapters while living in Trieste, giving English classes to support
	his family.</aside>

                English with James Joyce, and shares with him the preoccupation
                about "vital force" for the human beings. However, our
                preoccupation with making algorithms more accurate is sometimes
                similar: we worry about making them consume resources
                "recklessly", without trying to improve and find, as Svevo says,
