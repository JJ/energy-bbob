	paper</a>, the author talks about how Ulysses is pretty much about
	electrification and how it flows and can be measured. It literally says
	that it has "intense attention ... to the ways in which the lived
	            experience of individual bodies involves the disbursement of
	energy". In this case, the same happens with computers. James Joyce vive
	en Trieste entre 1905 y 1915; Ulysses was published in 1922; he wrote
	some chapters while living in Trieste, giving English classes to support
	his family.</aside>
